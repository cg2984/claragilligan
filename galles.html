			<h2 class="stage">Brainstorming and Sketching</h2>
				<p> In this stage I began to sketch my ideas on paper and in Illustrator. I wanted to play with a broad range of brandmarks and typography. At this stage I was experimenting with golf visual elements, and Martian visual elements. The smiley face comes from Galle's Crater, which is a crater on Mars that looks like a face. This is also the where I got the idea for the name.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Refining Sketches</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Since I had a lot of sketches, it was time to start refining them. I made my selections based on the feedback that I got from my classmates, and my professor. The feedback helped me refine my designs. The feedback was focused on the smiley face and the golf ball that turns into Mars, so I decided to iterate on those.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Final Iteration</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>I narrowed my selection down to one type of logo and began iterating on the small details. When making my final version I decided I wanted to work around the goofy off-kilter lettering, which I felt reflected the fun of a mini-golf course, and the half golf ball half Mars brandmark, which I felt married the two elements of my concept nicely.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Merchandise Application</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>When applying the logo to a piece of merch, there were a few changes that I had to implement. Since I wanted to iron my logo onto a hat I had to change the background of the logo. I made the background purple because the logo was easier to cut out of the paper, and because it is a complimentary color.</p>
