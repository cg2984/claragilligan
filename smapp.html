					<p> Design a logo for a Political Science lab that studies the link between social media and politics.</p>
					<h2 class = "statement_dec"> SOLUTION:</h2>
					<p>I wanted a design that was simple, bold, and serious. I also wanted a logo that could be applied to a variety of mediums.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">First Draft</h2>
			<hr>
			<p> I began my sketches on illustrator. I worked in black and white because I mostly wanted to focus on the forms. I thought that the "&" might be an interesting part of the logo so I included it in a few of the versions, but I also made sure to include some with just the acronym.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Second Draft</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>When the logo that they liked was chosen I began to tierate on it. For the second version I changed the colors, fonts, and line thicknesses. I was told to use the black, white, and purple colors. I added the green color since I thought it might be a nice calm color that would fit with this, professionally.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Third Draft</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>For this draft I was told to change out the serif in the "a" of SMaPP, so I expermiented with a couple styles and submitted them.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">Final Iteration</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>II got feedback on the other logos, and then submitted my final version. My final iterations was between italicized and non italicized text. I chose non-italicized because I felt that it fit better with the brandmark than the italic.</p>
