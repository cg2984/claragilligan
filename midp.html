					<h2 class="statement_dec">PROBLEM:</h2>
					<p> Design a logopiece of near-future technology to help someone with a disabillity in a deskless workspace. My team chose to design for a hard of hearing or deaf surgeon.</p>
					<h2 class = "statement_dec"> SOLUTION:</h2>
					<p>A pair of glasses that would convert speech to text, and alert the user to someone trying to speak to them from behind. My team's strategy was to divide the work. I worked on user testing, and the lo-fi prototypes.</p>

			<hr>
			<p>The first step was research. My team and I all contributed articles about hard of hearing people who had become doctors, and we found that is often very diffult for people  </p>

			<p>Since I had a lot of sketches, it was time to start refining them. I made my selections based on the feedback that I got from my classmates, and my professor.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">Final Iteration</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I narrowed my selection down to one type of logo and began iterating on the small details in tat logo. I eventually came to my final version because I liked the brandmark of the mars turning into the golfball. I also liked the goofy off-kilter lettering which I felt reflected fun.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">Merchandise Application</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Wehn applying the logo to a piece of merch, there were a few changes that I had to implement. Since I wanted to iron on my logo to a hat I had to change the background of the logo. The original logo has a transparent background, but this one has a purple background so that the logo is easier to cut out of the iron on paper. I chose purple because I thought that it was a nice complimentary color, and becasue I thought it had a similar space age fun feel.</p>
