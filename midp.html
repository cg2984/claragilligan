					<h2 class="statement_dec">PROBLEM:</h2>
					<p class = "statement_txt"> Design a logopiece of near-future technology to help someone with a disabillity in a deskless workspace. My team chose to design for a hard of hearing or deaf surgeon.</p>
					<h2 class = "statement_dec"> SOLUTION:</h2>
					<p class = "statement_txt">A pair of glasses that would convert speech to text, and alert the user to someone trying to speak to them from behind. It would also have limited capabilities for communication where someone could use thier eyes to select certain words and phrases. I worked on user testing, and the lo-fi prototypes.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">Brainstorming and Research</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>The first step was research. My team and I all contributed articles about hard of hearing people who had become doctors, and we found that is often very diffult for people to become doctors if they do not have access to an implant or a ASL interpreter. We also learned that even with an implant some people cannot hear all sounds. When thinking about the prompt, we realized that somone who might primarliy communicate through ASL would not be able to have aprofession that involves use of their hands, like a surgeon. So, our solution was an pair of AR glasses that visualizes speach, and has limited communication abilities.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Lo-Fi </h2>
			<hr>
			<p>For the Lo-Fi prototyper we just wanted a way to test the UI, since we couldn't make the googles in real life, and had limited access to an AR headset. So, we decided to make a version of the UI to be able to test to make sure that something that would be operated without hands.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">User Research</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>In order to user test the model we made an interative model in Marvel. We gave people specific prompts to follow so that we could see if there were any hitches with the UI. We did three rounds with these tests. And in total we tested 30 or so people. We did the tests in person and online. For in person, I would observe the people taking the tests and give them the prompt. Afterwards I would have them fill out a Google Form about the UI. For online, we just send people a link to the UI and have them fill out the form. After each round of feedback I would try to improve the UI.</p>
