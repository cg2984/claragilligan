					<h2 class="statement_dec">PROBLEM:</h2>
					<p> Design a logo for a brick and mortar STEM toy store that is expanding into the digital zone. The website has to have the community feel that the owner gets from the brick and mortart store, as well as a way for the buyers to get a real-life sense of the toy that they are buying.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">Brainstorming and Background Research</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>In this stage we began to plan out the issues that we would face for the project. One of the main ones that we immedialtye began to think about was who was the webstie for. The main purpose would be to sell STEM toys, so we decided that hte people visting would be buying toys for children. But, they wouldn't necessarily be the parents of the children, so they might not know exactly what they wanted from the toy store.</p>
			<br>
			<p> We also had to figure out the sections to divide the toys into. STEM was a logical first step since the toys are in those categories already. However, we considered atht someone buying toys might not really be thinking in those terms. To get a better sense of how toys are divided we went to a real toy store to see how real sotre owners decided to categorise the toys that they had. We were also able to get a sense of the questions are concerns that people have when buying toy by asking an emplyee at the store.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Sketching the Website</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>With the beginnings of the research under our belt we began to sketch out how the website would look. Out initial sketches were on paper so that we could just get the idea of the website down, rather than spending time refining a design that we might scrap soon anyways. There were 2 versions of sketches that we had to test on the users. </p>

			<h2 class="stage">Final Iteration</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I narrowed my selection down to one type of logo and began iterating on the small details in tat logo. I eventually came to my final version because I liked the brandmark of the mars turning into the golfball. I also liked the goofy off-kilter lettering which I felt reflected fun.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">Merchandise Application</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Wehn applying the logo to a piece of merch, there were a few changes that I had to implement. Since I wanted to iron on my logo to a hat I had to change the background of the logo. The original logo has a transparent background, but this one has a purple background so that the logo is easier to cut out of the iron on paper. I chose purple because I thought that it was a nice complimentary color, and becasue I thought it had a similar space age fun feel.</p>
