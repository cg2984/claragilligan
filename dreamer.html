				<hr>
				<p>For this project I was tasked with making a social media site. The website was coded in react, and hosted on netlify. The API that I called the post data from was made with an express server, and google firebase. I authenticated users in firebase as well.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Version 1: Coffee Shop</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>I wanted to have a social media site that is only open in the morning. When I thought about places that are only open in the morning, my immediate thought was to a cafe since it is a place where people can sit and contemplate ideas. The purpose of the app is to share your thoughts that you get while working at a cafe, and share them to others. Inspiration might strike when sharing and looking at others ideas. 

				A coffee shop is a warm, welcoming place. So I wanted to have warmer, coffee colors for the app. I also wanted to choose rounder, handwritten fonts, to evoke the handwritten signs in a coffee shop. I also wanted the posts to feel like pages out of a notebook, so I made them pop out a little, and have a line under the title.

			<h2 class ="stage">Version 2: Dreamer</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>I eventually pivoted my my idea from a cafe where people can post their ideas, to a dream journal where people can post their dreams. I wanted the dream journal to be warm like the coffee shop. I kept the layout that I made with the coffee shop, I just changed the color and the header typeface. I wanted the color for dreamer to be perriwinkle and soft rater than th ecoffee color of the Cafe. I also wanteds the header to be round and soft, so I went through a few iterations for that too.  </p>

				<h2 class="stage">Version 4: Dreamer</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>I decided that the light blue would be good as a way to differentiate the inputs from the posts themselves. I reverted the cards back to yellow, which I felt contrasted nicely with the blue background. It also evokes a notebook, which I though would be fitting for a dream journal site. I also changed the header typeface to one that is softer. </p>

				<h2 class="stage">Final Version</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>For this final version I changed the header the typeface. I felt that the other one was a bit too juvenille. The one I eventually landed on retained a bit of elegance that I wanted while still retaining some softness. </p>
