				<h2 class="stage">Version 1: Coffee Shop</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>I wanted to have a social media site that is only open in the morning. When I thought about places that are only open in the morning, my immediate thought was to a cafe since it is a place where people can sit and contemplate ideas. The purpose of the app is to share your thoughts that you get while working at a cafe, and share them to others. Inspiration might strike when sharing and looking at others ideas. 

				A coffee shop is a warm, welcoming place. So I wanted to have warmer, coffee colors for the app. I also wanted to choose rounder, handwritten fonts, to evoke the handwritten signs in a coffee shop. I also wanted the posts to feel like pages out of a notebook, so I made them pop out a little, and have a line under the title.
