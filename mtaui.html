				<p>Part of the project was to trade ideas, so that you are able to work with designing an idea that isn't your. The idea that I was gien was as way to see animals throught all stages of life. Since this project was hypothetically for the MTA, which is an integral part of New York City, I decided to focus the project on New York rather than all animals. </p>

				<hr>
				<p>For my first iteration I decided to test out different way of displaying the data. I wanted to play around with different shades of green since this UI is all about nature.</p>

				<p>For my final iteration I chose the version that looked the most academic. I thought it looked academic because of the serif fonts, and the muted colors. I also made the view of time a circle based on feedback given by my professor. He mentioned that with plants some of them are perennial and some of the are annual, so having a cyclical view of time for plants could push that message across.</p>
