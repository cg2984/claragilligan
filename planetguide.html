				<h2 class="stage">Brainstorming and Sketching</h2>
				<hr>
				<p> In this stage I began to sketch my ideas on paper and in Illustrator. I wanted to play with a broad range of brandmarks and typography. At this stage I was experimenting with golf visual elements, and Martian visual elements. The smiley face comes from Galle's Crater, which is a crater on Mars that looks like a face. This is also the where I got the idea for the name.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Lo-Fi Prototype</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The Lo-Fi stage was a way for me to just focus on layout, and to get it on Figma. I also focused on interaction between different elements, like the planet pages and the planet group pages, and tested out different versions of the AI assistant.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Stylesheet</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Before I started on the Hi-Fi prototype I began to think about the colors that and Icons that I would like to use. I was either going to go with a blue and white clean futuristic theme, or a purple and black holographic theme. I used moodboards, and iteration, to figure out my color scheme. I also worked on making the buttons and typefaces.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Hi-Fi Prototype 1</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In the high-fi prototype I was trying to apply the elements and colors that I had decided on in my stylesheet. I used the light colors that I had decided on, but I eventually realized that they werenâ€™t what I was going for visually. So, I moved towards a darker palette and began iterating on the color I would use. </p>

				<h2 class="stage">Final Version</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>This stage was all about finalizing details, like visualizations and icons, and tying up loose ends. I added a comparison feature, a search by location feature, and overlays that display information on the map planets. I decided to add these after I made a couple user journeys. Lastly, I decided to make the charts on the planet page reflect the make-up of the planet, which my users indicated they would like to see.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Stylesheet</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The final version of the stylesheet has all of the final colors and gradients, the text styling, the base elements, the completed elements, and the spacing between elements. The point of a stylesheet is to make sure that there is consistent styling, so I took some time to sort out and mark each section. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how exactly to make sections, but I landed on horzontal lines becasue I could easily group together alternate stylings.</p>
